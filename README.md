What is this?
-------------

A plugin for [Snagit](http://www.techsmith.com/snagit.html) that allows sending captured images to online image sharing sites, such as [http://imgur.com](http://imgur.com).

This plugin adds a button on the **Send** tab of the Image Editor, allowing you to upload the currently selected image to **Imgur**:

It is also added to the main menu:

You can change the position of the **Imgur** button in the Editor Options.

Installation instructions
=========================

Please read carefully!
----------------------

To install this plugin:

1. Extract the contents of the zip file into:  

    `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\TechSmith\Snagit\Accessories`

2. Go to the extracted directory:  

    `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\TechSmith\Snagit\Accessories\{EDA9F1DD-85B9-44F6-9D3C-125B2DD1109D}`

    and run the file **register.bat**

3. Restart Snagit (you should choose _Exit Snagit_ from the icon in the notification area)

A proper installer will be available in the future!
---------------------------------------------------

What can it do now?
-------------------

The plugin uploads the currently selected image in the Snagit Editor to imgur.com, and opens a browser with a link to the uploaded image.

It currently only uploads as PNG, and uses an anonymous upload.

What will it do in the future?
------------------------------

Oh, many things:

* Using own imgur account
* Choosing uploading format
* Multiple image hosts support
* Installer!
* Many other cool stuff

Please report any [issues](https://github.com/hmemcpy/SnagitImageShare/issues) that you might have!

Thanks!
