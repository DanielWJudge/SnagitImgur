What is this?
-------------

A plugin ("accessory") for [Snagit](http://www.techsmith.com/snagit.html) that allows sending captured images to online image sharing sites, such as [http://imgur.com](http://imgur.com).

This plugin adds a button on the **Send** tab of the Image Editor, allowing you to upload the currently selected image to **Imgur**:

It is also added to the main menu:

You can change the position of the **Imgur** button in the Editor Options.

Download and installation instructions
======================================

Download the file `SnagitImgur.snagacc` from the [Downloads](https://github.com/hmemcpy/SnagitImgur/downloads) page.

Double-click the `SnagitImgur.snagacc` file, and it will be automatically installed in Snagit!


What can it do now?
-------------------

The plugin uploads the currently selected image in the Snagit Editor to imgur.com, and opens a browser with a link to the uploaded image.

It currently only uploads as PNG, and uses an anonymous upload.

What will it do in the future?
------------------------------

Oh, many things:

* Using own imgur account
* Choosing uploading format
* Multiple image hosts support
* Installer!
* Many other cool stuff
